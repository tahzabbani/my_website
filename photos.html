                        everyday and they both slept all them time because of their sicknesses - it was tough to watch. Their infections got worse so I had to give them back to the humane society so the vets could look at them. <br> <br> Rating: 15/10

                    <figcaption><strong>Cheese Puff</strong> <br> September 2019 <br> <br> Cheese Puff was one of my most noteworthy kittens. I brought him home as he was a very scared kitten but within the next day, he gradually opened up with the use of toys and
                        patience. He became very loving and playful. I had him for over a month and soon found out that a relative of mine wanted to adopt him. So, I kept him after he got his neutering surgery and went with my relative to the humane society
                        to have him adopted. I see pictures of him all the time now. <br> <br> Rating: 16/10</figcaption>

                    <figcaption><strong>Mouse</strong> <br> April 2020 <br> <br> Mouse was a 1 year old cat that was surrendered by her previous owner. She had been in a hoarding situation so she was very scared and unwilling to trust. Mouse became a little more
                        comfortable as time passed, but it never got to the point where I was able to touch her. She would only play with toys from a distance which made it difficult when I needed her in a kennel to take to the shelter for check-ups.
                        I just know that she loved laser pointers. I got a call after a couple weeks into the foster that she was going to get adopted and she is now in her forever home! <br> <br> Rating: 14/10</figcaption>

                    <figcaption><strong>Magneto</strong> <br> May 2020 <br> <br> Magneto was a 3 year old cat that was one of the sweetest cats I had ever met. He was also surrendered by his previous owner for dumb reasons. The owners said that he was always chasing
                        and attacking their family which he did none of when he was with me. He always went to bed at the same time as me and sat in my lap as I was on my computer. And whenever there was a toy out, he would turn into an incredibly playful
                        cat. I even thought about adopting him myself for a while. About two weeks in, I got a call that he was getting adopted! <br> <br> Rating: 15.6/10</figcaption>

                        so fast. He just ate so much. He also loved to follow me around the apartment and always have me in line of sight. I'm not sure why, but I guess he just liked being close. <br> <br> Rating: 14/10</figcaption>
